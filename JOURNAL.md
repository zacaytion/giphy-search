## Monday March 12

I started the project today. Spent some time over the weekend getting a grasp of TypeScript in order to use it for the project. Most of my time today was configuring and setting up TypeScript, Babel and Webpack.

Initially I wanted to the new Webpack v4, but after some time tinkering, I decided to downgrade to v3 as it doesn't seem like the typescript loaders for v4 are working properly.

Currently have Webpack setup with Hot-Module loading for React. Also used the `HtmlWebpackPlugin` and the `html-webpack-template` to auto-generate an `index.html` file instead of creating one myself. The current set up should be fine, but if I have extra time I may tinker with it some more and create a production version.

Didn't have much time to work on the project today. I spent my time setting up React Router and Redux. And built out the skeleton of the application.
