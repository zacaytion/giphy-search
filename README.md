## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

This app requires `node >= 8.9` and `yarn` to be installed globally.

### Install Dependencies

### Run App In Development

Start the `webpack-dev-server` by running the command `yarn start`.

### Build Production

To build an optimized production version of the app, run `yarn build`.

### Fix Linting Errors

`yarn fix` will run  both `tslint` and `prettier` and attempt to fix any issues.

### Don't Get Hacked!

Run `yarn test:security` to check for any vulnerable dependencies.
